# Mechanics Database
The Mechanics Database is a basic application used for the management of information regarding a mechanic garage. This application gives information on vehicles and customers that enter the garage. It also gives information on employees, repairs, and parts. This application allows employees to create, read, update, and delete all information regarding the database. Customers can view repair status and update their own personal and vehicle information.
